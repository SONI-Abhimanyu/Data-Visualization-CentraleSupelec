# Data-Visualization-CentraleSupelec
State of Data Science - Kaggle Survey 2021
Repository for the Data Viz course, part of DSBA ESSEC-CentraleSupelec
Task: Interactive visualizations for analysing & deriving insights from Kaggle’s survey of it’s users

Focus:
Our selected sketch provides the most essential and varied information from the survey with just a few meaningful graphs:
Here we want the user of the dashboard firstly to notice the difference in mean salaries 
globally, depicted by the size of the bubble over each country. The user will have the option 
to hover over any country that they are interested in (and is available in the dataset) and 
gain further information on the Kagglers within that country.
Furthermore, the user will have access to a summarized view of each profession and is 
provided further information on industry, skills, salary and employer in a compact view
